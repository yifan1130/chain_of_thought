# Tricks in chain-of-thought prompt engineering 
Still under construction. 

* Use complex prompt over simple prompts 
```
# complex prompt
TODO: a complex GSM8K case

# simple prompt 
TODO: a simple GSM8K case
```

* Use linebreaks more often. The model also need a breath when reading prompts 
```
# a case without linebreak

# a case with linebreak 

```

* Emphasize the imporant parts in the prompt. The model will listen 
```
# plan CoT, no emphasize
Q: Which statement is sarcastic?
Options:
(A) Consistency in the league's punishments? What do you think this is supposed to be, politics?
