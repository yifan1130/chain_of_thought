TODO:
* read the example prompts in `gsm8k`
* complete the standard prompts for MMLU
* currently do chat format first 

Pay attention:
* you may want to start with `abstract_algebra/chat/few_shot_cot.chatml` as an example 
* "let's think step by step" is the end of users' round, not the start of the assistant's round
* Seperate the assistent reasoning steps using linebreaks, don't put them in one line (the model needs a breath). 
* If the prompt includes sentence like "statement 2 is false", make sure they are after their reasons, rather than before.
